## Courses January - April 2024

**Course presentation**

This course we will end with a presentation in a the theater on Thursday April 25th. On Wednesday April 24 we have the general rehearsal for all participating in the presentation

To prepare for the show, we commit the last few classes to make acts in small groups.

**Wednesday**

In January a new course starts. This would be a good moment to pick up acrobatics again (or continue).

The Wednesday acrobatics class is designed for individuals with a considerable amount of acrobatics experience. We provide a range of L-base and standing tricks and exercises to enhance your acrobatics practice.


- 18:45 - 19:45 Handstand lesson
- 20:00 - 21:30 Advanced class
- 21:30 - 22:30 Open training

Because it is very vague to describe the level required in words, we have filmed some tricks to give an indication of the minimum level you can expect during the class.

If you think these tricks are still too challenging, we advise taking the beginners class on Thursday
