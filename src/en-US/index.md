Kat and Kiljan are traveling around the globe, performing and teaching partner acrobatics together. They have taught in all over Europe. They are thrilled to have the opportunity to get to know and share their acro and handstand skills with the community in Utrecht, thanks to Acrobatiekvereniging Op de Kop.

Learning new skills is one of the many things people love about acro and handstands, likely because it makes them feel alive and accomplished. Kat and Kiljan love being part of the moment when people surprise themselves by achieving a new skill that seemed out of reach but is attainable with a bit of training and knowledge.

We will also pay attention on spotting techniques so everyone feels comfortable and safe.
