"Op De Kop" (Upside Down) is a brand new acrobatics association in Utrecht
founded by 8 acrobats. There are classes every Wednesday from September 15
onwards. The lessons will be taught by experienced acrobatics trainerss.

The classes are for everyone 16 years or over. You do NOT need experience with
acrobatics, nor do you need to be strong or flexible. Taking classes will result
in strength and flexibility.
