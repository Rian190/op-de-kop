## Handstand workshop 

- Friday 25th November 19:00h - 21:30h
- Saturday 26th November 10:00h - 13:00h.

This workshop is a full immersion into the handbalance world with Sam on Hands who will guide you towards the discovery of perceptions, alignments, techniques, mental and physical challenges and new body awareness.

In a perfect mix between expertise and fun, we’ll use tailored practices to gradually build what you need to be able to feel your body upside down.

This workshop will give you a solid understanding of the handstand foundation, a better body awareness/feeling while performing a handstand, how to keep working on your goals in the upcoming weeks.

The more experienced participants will gain a better understanding on how the very small details and refinements can totally improve their learning process and more easily achieve their goal.
