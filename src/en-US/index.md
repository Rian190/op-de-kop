Op De Kop (Upside Down) is a brand new acrobatics association in Utrecht founded
by 8 acrobats. We're organising weekly classes from September 15 onwards. The
lessons will be taught by an experienced acrobatics trainer.

<br/>

The classes are for everyone 16 years or over. You do NOT need experience with
acrobatics, nor do you need to be strong or flexible. Taking classes will result
in strength and flexibility.

<br/>
