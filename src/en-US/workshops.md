A deep dive into L-base pops. We will explore different ways of throwing the flyer into the air and catching nicely.

During this workshop you will learn new tricks which are super nice by itself. And at the same time, it will be a preparation for the real Icarians, if they are on your wishlist!

You can register by emailing us at info@op-de-kop.nl.

After the workshop, there is a jam in the same studio. You are welcome to stay for more practice!
