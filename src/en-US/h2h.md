## Prerequisites:

To participate, you need a basic level of acrobatics skill. To ensure a productive learning experience, participants must meet certain requirements in acrobatics:

**Flyers:**
- Hold a handstand for at least 30 seconds. This can also be done with a wall or spotter.
- Be able to enter a handstand independently.
- Be able to practice handstands without a spotter.

**Bases:**
- Hold a foot-to-hand position for at least 30 seconds, whether in L-base or S-base.
- Be able to support a partner above your head (e.g., high bird).

## Registration

For the quality of the lesson, it's important to have a good balance between the number of bases and flyers.

You can register as a flyer or base. We allow an equal number of flyers and bases in the course.

- **Registration with a Partner:** If you and a partner want to register together, with one taking on the role of flyer and the other as a base, you will both be guaranteed access.
- **Individual Registration:** If you register individually, we will try to match bases and flyers as much as possible. It may happen that we don't have a spot for you.

The registration fee for the course is €65. We understand that financial situations can vary and, therefore, offer a generous 25% discount to those who need it.
