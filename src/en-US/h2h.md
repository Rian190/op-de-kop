## Prerequisites:

To ensure a productive learning experience, participants are required to meet certain prerequisites in acrobatics:

- **Flyers:** To join as a flyer, it's essential that you can confidently execute a handstand and maintain it for a minimum of 15 seconds. This can be performed with the assistance of a wall or a spotter for support for balance.
  - **Bases:** Aspiring bases should have the ability to hold a foot-to-hand position for at least 10 seconds.

## Enrollment

We take great care in maintaining an equitable ratio of flyers to bases, striving for a balanced 50/50 representation.
Here are the enrollment details:

- **Enroll with a Partner:** If you and a partner wish to enroll together, where one takes on the flyer role and the other the base role, both of you will be guaranteed entry.
  - **Solo Enrollment:** For individuals who choose to enroll independently, we will ensure a balanced mix of bases and flyers based on the order of subscription. It is possible we are not able to find a suitable partner and thus have to deny your subscription.

The course registration fee is â‚¬65. We understand that financial situations can vary, and as such, we offer a compassionate 25% discount to those who require it.
